# emacs-docker

Currently no build system behind this.

The `Dockerfile` in `git/` will use an Ubuntu-based image to build the latest version of Emacs from git.

The `Dockerfile` in `alpine/` uses an alpine-based image to run the latest alpine-provided version of Emacs, since they are up-to-date with stable.
